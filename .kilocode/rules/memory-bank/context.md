- Created CHANGELOG.md with initial v1.0.0 entry.
- Package version set to 1.0.0 in pubspec.yaml.
- Added docs/ directory for documentation.

Next steps

- Matrix4 fix pushed to main branch.
- Monitor GitHub Actions CI pipeline (should trigger automatically on push).

- Update README with demo URL/badge after site confirmation.
- Prepare for v1.0.0 release: update quality gates, enhance CHANGELOG.md, deploy example to GitHub Pages.
- Consider roadmap items: GlassMorphBottomSheet, GlassMorphDialog, Figma plugin.
